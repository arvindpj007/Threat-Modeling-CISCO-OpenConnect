# Threat Modelling

VPN is a service that creates an secure encrypted connection between the client and the server over an open unsecure network. As large number of companies are becoming mobile, employees need to connect to their systems over unsecured networks remotely, hence they are susceptible to use VPN to access their data. Attackers can target these services to breach the security of the company’s network and access their private data. Hence, this became our primary motivation to assess threat scenarios related to an open-source VPN. Therefor we are doing threat modelling for imminent insecurities on our chosen open-source VPN Client – OpenConnect.
